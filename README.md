# ANOVA_R
A little script to conduct an ANOVA and Tukey or Skot-Knott test in R
There are two scripts:
  One using the ExpDes R package (Which I particularly prefer, because the output prints the letter in the means comparison test)
  And the other a script using native R functions

The results are the same actually
